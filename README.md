# Classification of tomato diseases based on photos of leaves

The project aims to create a model to predict tomato disease from photos of the leaves. The choice of the subject of the project came from an unpleasant surprise that recently happened to one of my family members. My grandmother was growing tomatoes and one day she noticed some spots on the leaves. Unfortunately, she failed to recognize the tomato disease and her entire plantation died. Perhaps if there was an application using the model I created, it would be possible to prevent this disaster.

Project workflow:
- Obtaining photos related to the analyzed problem.
- Features scaling and Data augmentation.
- Choosing CNN architecture.
- Compiling the model.
- Checking its accuracy.
- Saving model.
